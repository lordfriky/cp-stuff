Competitive programming stuff (WIP)

> I can't guarantee that all the solutions in this repo are right, as some of them were WIPs that I never came back to and gave me WA or PA (depending if they were IOI or ICPC style problems). (maybe I'll clean them up or solve them correctly in the future, but right now I'm busy for the time being)
